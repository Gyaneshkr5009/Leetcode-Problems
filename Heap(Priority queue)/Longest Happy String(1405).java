/*
    Key Approach:

    Use a Priority Queue:
        Store the characters ('a', 'b', 'c') and their frequencies in a max-heap so that you always work with the most frequent character first.

    Greedy Selection:
        Always append the most frequent character unless it has already been added twice consecutively (this prevents invalid sequences).
        If the most frequent character cannot be used (due to the consecutive rule), use the second most frequent character.

    Backtracking:
        Decrease the frequency of the character used, and if it still has occurrences left, add it back to the heap.

    Edge Case Handling:
        Handle the case where no valid next character is available by checking the second top character in the heap.

Complexity:

    Time Complexity: O(n log 3) â‰ˆ O(n) (since the heap only stores 3 elements at most, log 3 is constant).
    Space Complexity: O(1) (for storing the characters and counts).
