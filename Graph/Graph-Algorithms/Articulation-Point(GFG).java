      Key Approach:

    Adjacency List Representation:
        The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each node is connected to other nodes via edges.

    Articulation Point Definition:
        An articulation point (cut vertex) in a graph is a vertex, that when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph. These points are critical for maintaining the graph's connectivity.

    Tarjan's Algorithm for Articulation Points:
        Tarjan's algorithm uses DFS to explore the graph and find articulation points. The algorithm relies on the discovery time (tin[]) and the lowest time reachable (low[]) for each node during DFS traversal.

    DFS with Discovery and Low-Link Time:
        During DFS traversal, for each node v, we track:
            tin[v]: Discovery time of the node v.
            low[v]: The lowest discovery time of any node that can be reached from v or its descendants.
        For each node, we update its low[] based on the low[] values of its adjacent nodes (children in DFS tree).

    Articulation Point Conditions:
        A node u is an articulation point if:
            Condition 1: It is the root node of the DFS tree and has more than one child.
            Condition 2: For any non-root node u, there exists a child v such that low[v] >= tin[u]. This means that the subtree rooted at v cannot connect to any ancestors of u, making u critical for connecting the subtree.

    Marking Articulation Points:
        We use an additional array mark[] to flag nodes that are articulation points.
        If the node meets the above conditions, it is marked as an articulation point.

    Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
        Each node and edge is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

    Space Complexity: O(V + E) for storing the adjacency list and auxiliary arrays.

Explanation of Core Concepts:

    DFS Traversal: A recursive DFS is used to explore the graph, where each node's discovery and lowest reachable times are calculated.
    Backtracking: When backtracking from a node, its low[] value is updated based on its child nodes, and the conditions for articulation points are checked.
    Root Condition: For the root node, the articulation point condition is differentâ€”if it has more than one child, it is a cut vertex because removing it disconnects its children from each other.
